# Pokefier Base Code #
Hello! Welcome to Pokefier's repository.
This is now an open-source discord bot.

>**Self-hosting**
This is the best option for the devs and curious users, since it allows you to maintain and modify without affecting anyone else. Unfortunately, this requires a reasonable knowledge of computers and Discord.

### Config
This version uses `config.json` file to configure its core variables, in the repository you will find a `config.json` file and you must fill in the configuration variables.

| Variable | Function |
| ------ | ------ |
